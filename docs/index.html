Rolling hills are shown in dark purples, lit up by a glowing lightening strike in the top centre of the sky. A white bird flies in from the left hand side, and a crown lays abandoned on the hills. The title of the play sits in the middle of the lower third of the image, with Shakespeare's name just below, justified to the right.">

    <p class="first">King Lear of Britain, in an attempt to avoid unrest, decides to divide his kingdom between his three daughters, each portion depending on their declaration of loyalty to him. His elder two, Reagan and Goneril, succeed in his affections through lies and deceit. However Cordelia, the youngest, unable to put her true loyalty to words, is banished.</p>

    <p>King Lear gradually sinks into maddness after       realising his eldest daughters’ lies, and is filled with guilt for how he treated the kind Cordelia.  A classic story of blindness and sight, loyalty and betrayal, Shakespeare’s tragedy explores the importance of humility and truth in love.</p>
